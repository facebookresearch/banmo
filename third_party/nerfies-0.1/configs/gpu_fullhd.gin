# This is a Full HD (1080p-ish) configuration.
# The image scale is based on our input video size of 1920x1080.
# This configuration requires 8 GPUs to train.
#
# To make this runnable on fewer GPUs, decrease the `batch_size` and scale the
# learning rate by the sqrt of the factor by which you decreased it. Expect
# the results to look slightly worse without tuning.
